Welcome to my project repository! I am excited to share my journey in developing a cutting-edge restaurant kiosk application. This app is designed to streamline the dining experience, providing an intuitive interface for customers to place orders efficiently. Here's what makes our project special:

Framework: Built with the robust Spring framework, our application ensures scalability and reliability, making it perfect for handling the dynamic needs of modern restaurants.

Database Integration: I've integrated PostgreSQL, a powerful and open-source object-relational database system, to ensure fast, reliable access to menu items, orders, and customer data.

User-Centric Design: The kiosk app features a user-friendly interface, designed to make the ordering process as simple and enjoyable as possible for customers of all ages.

I am committed to continuous improvement and eagerly welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the developer community. Dive into code, explore the features, and join me in shaping the future of restaurant dining!
